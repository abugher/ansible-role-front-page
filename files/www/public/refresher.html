        <b>What is this?</b>  This page keeps login sessions from expiring by continually refreshing authenticated connections.  Add a URL to create a new entry in the list.  Remove an entry to stop refreshing that page.  When you have added enough sites, bookmark this page to preserve your list of pages to be prepared in case of browser session loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why doesn't it work?</b>  It works for some sites.  Most sites, though, will set <i>X-Frame-Options</i> to <i>sameorigin</i> or <i>deny</i>.  In that case, your browser will refuse to load the site in a frame.  (Chromium and probably Chrome will just lie about the nature of the problem.  Firefox almost tells the truth:  <i>[site] will not allow Firefox to display the page ...</i>  The site can only advise.  The browser makes the decision.  It's a <i>good</i> decision, but browser makers are being dirty lying cowards with their error messages.)

      <p>
        <b>Can I make it work?</b>  If you hack your browser to disregard that header, this page should work great, but that would compromise your security.  If you can limit the exception to only this page or site, that should be fine.  If you copy the source code of this page to a file on your computer, you should be able to browse that file and avoid trusting any server.
